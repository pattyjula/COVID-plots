# COVID-plots
COVID web scraping and plotting with beautifulsoup, requests, seaborn, and more

## CDC folder

Contains plots of CDC cases and deaths. The web scraping worked, but then they changed the website, so it's still in progress.

## LosAngelesNeighborhoods folder

Contains data on neighborhoods in Los Angeles. The daily shapefile is provided as well as a CSV of all the days since I started this scraping in early April 2020.

## Google folder

A quick plot of a Google CSV of people's movement in Los Angeles County, updated weekly, since February.
